  abstract = {Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (``avoiding side effects'' and ``avoiding reward hacking''), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (``scalable supervision''), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (``safe exploration'' and ``distributional shift''). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

Supervised classification is one of the tasks most frequently carried out by the intelligent systems. This paper describes various Supervised Machine Learning (ML) classification techniques, compares various supervised learning algorithms as well as determines the most efficient classification algorithm based on the data set, the number of instances and variables (features).Seven different machine learning algorithms were considered:Decision Table, Random Forest (RF) , Na\"ive Bayes (NB) , Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (Perceptron), JRip and Decision Tree (J48) using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA)machine learning tool.To implement the algorithms, Diabetes data set was used for the classification with 786 instances with eight attributes as independent variable and one as dependent variable for the analysis. The results show that SVMwas found to be the algorithm with most precision and accuracy. Na\"ive Bayes and Random Forest classification algorithms were found to be the next accurate after SVM accordingly. The research shows that time taken to build a model and precision (accuracy) is a factor on one hand; while kappa statistic and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is another factor on the other hand. Therefore, ML algorithms requires precision, accuracy and minimum error to have supervised predictive machine learning.},

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory.},

  abstract = {Background: To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. Results: The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. Conclusions: In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

This paper reflects a model designed to measure the various parameters of data in a network such as accuracy, precision, confusion matrix, and others. XGBoost is employed on the NSL-KDD (network socket layer-knowledge discovery in databases) dataset to get the desired results. The whole motive is to learn about the integrity of data and have a higher accuracy in the prediction of data. By doing so, the amount of mischievous data floating in a network can be minimized, making the network a secure place to share information. The more secure a network is, the fewer situations where data is hacked or modified. By changing various parameters of the model, future research can be done to get the most out of the data entering and leaving a network. The most important player in the network is data, and getting to know it more closely and precisely is half the work done. Studying data in a network and analyzing the pattern and volume of data leads to the emergence of a solid Intrusion Detection System (IDS), that keeps the network healthy and a safe place to share confidential information.},

The study presented in this paper sets out to explore the degree to which imbalance has been treated and provide a taxonomy of the machine learning approaches developed using these datasets. A survey of published works related to these datasets was done to deliver a combined qualitative and quantitative methodological approach for our analysis towards deriving a taxonomy. The research presented here confirms that the impact of bias due to the imbalance datasets is rarely addressed. This data supports further research and development of supervised machine learning techniques which reduce the impact of bias in classification or prediction due to these imbalance datasets.},

As a consequence, click prediction systems are central to most online advertising systems. With over 750 million daily active users and over 1 million active advertisers, predicting clicks on Facebook ads is a challenging machine learning task. In this paper we introduce a model which combines decision trees with logistic regression, outperforming either of these methods on its own by over 3\%, an improvement with significant impact to the overall system performance. We then explore how a number of fundamental parameters impact the final prediction performance of our system. Not surprisingly, the most important thing is to have the right features: those capturing historical information about the user or ad dominate other types of features. Once we have the right features and the right model (decisions trees plus logistic regression), other factors play small roles (though even small improvements are important at scale). Picking the optimal handling for data freshness, learning rate schema and data sampling improve the model slightly, though much less than adding a high-value feature, or picking the right model to begin with.},

As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network-based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS-based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL-based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. Using the shortcomings of the proposed methods, we highlighted various research challenges and provided the future scope for the research in improving ML and DL-based NIDS.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks often suffer from overconfidence which can be partly remedied by improved outof-distribution detection. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach that allows for the generation of outof-distribution datasets based on a given in-distribution dataset. This new dataset can then be used to improve out-of-distribution detection for the given dataset and machine learning task at hand. The samples in this dataset are with respect to the feature space close to the in-distribution dataset and therefore realistic and plausible. Hence, this dataset can also be used to safeguard neural networks, i.e., to validate the generalization performance. Our approach first generates suitable representations of an in-distribution dataset using an autoencoder and then transforms them using our novel proposed Soft Brownian Offset method. After transformation, the decoder part of the autoencoder allows for the generation of these implicit out-of-distribution samples. This newly generated dataset then allows for mixing with other datasets and thus improved training of an out-of-distribution classifier, increasing its performance. Experimentally, we show that our approach is promising for time series using synthetic data. Using our new method, we also show in a quantitative case study that we can improve the out-of-distribution detection for the MNIST dataset. Finally, we provide another case study on the synthetic generation of out-ofdistribution trajectories, which can be used to validate trajectory prediction algorithms for automated driving.},

  abstract = {Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and thereby presenting increasing challenges in accurately detecting intrusions. Failure to prevent the intrusions could degrade the credibility of security services, e.g. data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Numerous intrusion detection methods have been proposed in the literature to tackle computer security threats, which can be broadly classified into Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (SIDS) and Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (AIDS). This survey paper presents a taxonomy of contemporary IDS, a comprehensive review of notable recent works, and an overview of the datasets commonly used for evaluation purposes. It also presents evasion techniques used by attackers to avoid detection and discusses future research challenges to counter such techniques so as to make computer systems more secure.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, researchers, practitioners and companies struggled for devising mechanisms to detect cyber-security threats. Among others, those efforts originated rule-based, signature-based or supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that were proven effective for detecting those intrusions that have already been encountered and characterized. Instead, new unknown threats, often referred to as zero-day attacks or zero-days, likely go undetected as they are often misclassified by those techniques. In recent years, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms showed potential to detect zero-days. However, dedicated support for quantitative analyses of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms is still scarce and often does not promote meta-learning, which has potential to improve classification performance. To such extent, this paper introduces the problem of zero-days and reviews unsupervised algorithms for their detection. Then, the paper applies a question-answer approach to identify typical issues in conducting quantitative analyses for zero-days detection, and shows how to setup and exercise unsupervised algorithms with appropriate tooling. Using a very recent attack dataset, we debate on i) the impact of features on the detection performance of unsupervised algorithms, ii) the relevant metrics to evaluate intrusion detectors, iii) means to compare multiple unsupervised algorithms, iv) the application of meta-learning to reduce misclassifications. Ultimately, v) we measure detection performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms with respect to zero-days. Overall, the paper exemplifies how to practically orchestrate and apply an appropriate methodology, process and tool, providing even non-experts with means to select appropriate strategies to deal with zero-days.},

It is well known that ML outputs are not reliable when testing data are novel with regards to model training and validation data, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. We implement an unsupervised deep neural network-based OOD detector on a real-time embedded autonomous Duckiebot and evaluate detection performance. Our OOD detector produces a success rate of 87.5\% for emergency stopping a Duckiebot on a braking test bed we designed. We also provide case analysis on computing resource challenges specific to the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware on the Duckiebot.},
