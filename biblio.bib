IDS has taken much of the attention of researchers, IDS monitors the resources computer and sends reports on the activities of any anomaly or strange patterns. The aim of this paper is to explain the stages of the evolution of the idea of IDS and its importance to researchers and research centres, security, military and to examine the importance of intrusion detection systems and categories , classifications, and where can put IDS to reduce the risk to the network.},

  abstract = {With the increasing amount of network throughput and security threat, the study of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has received a lot of attention throughout the computer science field. Current IDSs pose challenges on not only capricious intrusion categories, but also huge computational power. Though there is a number of existing literatures to IDS issues, we attempt to give a more elaborate image for a comprehensive review. Through the extensive survey and sophisticated organization, we propose the taxonomy to outline modern IDSs. In addition, tables and figures we summarized in the content contribute to easily grasp the overall picture of IDSs.},

  abstract = {The rapid advances in the internet and communication fields have resulted in a huge increase in the network size and the corresponding data. As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network-based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS-based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL-based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. Using the shortcomings of the proposed methods, we highlighted various research challenges and provided the future scope for the research in improving ML and DL-based NIDS.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks often suffer from overconfidence which can be partly remedied by improved outof-distribution detection. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach that allows for the generation of outof-distribution datasets based on a given in-distribution dataset. This new dataset can then be used to improve out-of-distribution detection for the given dataset and machine learning task at hand. The samples in this dataset are with respect to the feature space close to the in-distribution dataset and therefore realistic and plausible. Hence, this dataset can also be used to safeguard neural networks, i.e., to validate the generalization performance. Our approach first generates suitable representations of an in-distribution dataset using an autoencoder and then transforms them using our novel proposed Soft Brownian Offset method. After transformation, the decoder part of the autoencoder allows for the generation of these implicit out-of-distribution samples. This newly generated dataset then allows for mixing with other datasets and thus improved training of an out-of-distribution classifier, increasing its performance. Experimentally, we show that our approach is promising for time series using synthetic data. Using our new method, we also show in a quantitative case study that we can improve the out-of-distribution detection for the MNIST dataset. Finally, we provide another case study on the synthetic generation of out-ofdistribution trajectories, which can be used to validate trajectory prediction algorithms for automated driving.},

Failure to prevent the intrusions could degrade the credibility of security services, e.g. data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Numerous intrusion detection methods have been proposed in the literature to tackle computer security threats, which can be broadly classified into Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (SIDS) and Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (AIDS). This survey paper presents a taxonomy of contemporary IDS, a comprehensive review of notable recent works, and an overview of the datasets commonly used for evaluation purposes. It also presents evasion techniques used by attackers to avoid detection and discusses future research challenges to counter such techniques so as to make computer systems more secure.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, researchers, practitioners and companies struggled for devising mechanisms to detect cyber-security threats. Among others, those efforts originated rule-based, signature-based or supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that were proven effective for detecting those intrusions that have already been encountered and characterized. Instead, new unknown threats, often referred to as zero-day attacks or zero-days, likely go undetected as they are often misclassified by those techniques. In recent years, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms showed potential to detect zero-days. However, dedicated support for quantitative analyses of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms is still scarce and often does not promote meta-learning, which has potential to improve classification performance. To such extent, this paper introduces the problem of zero-days and reviews unsupervised algorithms for their detection. Then, the paper applies a question-answer approach to identify typical issues in conducting quantitative analyses for zero-days detection, and shows how to setup and exercise unsupervised algorithms with appropriate tooling. Using a very recent attack dataset, we debate on i) the impact of features on the detection performance of unsupervised algorithms, ii) the relevant metrics to evaluate intrusion detectors, iii) means to compare multiple unsupervised algorithms, iv) the application of meta-learning to reduce misclassifications. Ultimately, v) we measure detection performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms with respect to zero-days. Overall, the paper exemplifies how to practically orchestrate and apply an appropriate methodology, process and tool, providing even non-experts with means to select appropriate strategies to deal with zero-days.},
